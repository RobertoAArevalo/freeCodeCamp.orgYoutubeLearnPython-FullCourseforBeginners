#Lesson 13 - Return Statement

# collection of python code that performs a specific task.
# We call on fucntions to perform it.
# A function to cube a number
# return is required to make the function work, and get information back from a function

def cube(num):
    return num*num*num # no code can be used after this return statement like
    #print ("code") won't work here

result = cube(4) #variable result will store value from the cube function
print(result)

# a string, bullion or array can be returned.
