#Lesson 5 - Working with Numbers

#numbers are a very common type of data type.

#print(2)
#   Will print the number
#   Can also use PEMDAS

# print(10 % 3)
#   This is read 10 mod 3. This is taken the quotient and giving the remainder

# my_num = 5
# print(my_num)
#   numbers can also be printed when declared as a variable and printing the respective variable

# my_num = 5
# print(str(my_num)
#   This can be used to effectively to turing a variable that is a number into a string.
# print(str(my_num) + "my favorite number")

# my_num = -5
# print(abs(my_num)
    # using abs will provide the absolute value

# my_num = -5
# print(pow(3,2))
    # pow allows me to pass or give 2 pieces of information.
    # The function will have a number and the 2nd number will take the 1st number to the power of
    # It will take 3^2

#print(max(4,10))
    # The max function will return the larger of the two numbers that have been passed into it.
    # min will do the opposite.

# print(round(3.2))
    # The round function will round the number

from math import*
    # Importing can be done on Python. This is when external code is imported into our file.
    # from math import* is importing this external file.
    # This is a type of module. It is a math module with gives us access to more math functions.


#print(floor(7.2))
    #The floor function will round down avoiding math rules.

#print(ceil(8.1))
    #This function will round up avoiding math rules.

#print(sqrt(25))
    # the sqrt function will retrieve the square root of a number.

my_num = -5
print(sqrt(25))

# Many of the math functions covered in this lesson are very commonly used.
