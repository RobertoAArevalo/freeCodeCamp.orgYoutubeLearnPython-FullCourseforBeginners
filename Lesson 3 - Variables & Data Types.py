#data can be diff. to manage to variables - which can be used as containers, can store certain data values
#Variables help us manage our data inside of all of our programs.



charcter_name = "Tom"
character_age = "30"
x = 10
is_Male = False
print("There once was a man named " + charcter_name + ",")
print("He was " + character_age + " years old.")

charcter_name = "Mike"
print("He really liked the name " + charcter_name + ",")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ".")

# I can manually change the characters name and age.
# I can create a variable to do this for me.
# A charcter name needs to be created in order to use it as a variable.
# In python separate words with an underscore.
# If this variable is used with a changed named, it will use the newest name.

#There are different type of data that can be stored inside of these variables
#What is being store (i.e. "Tom") is a string.
#A string is plain text.
# "There once was a man named" is also a string.
# There is a data type in python known as a string, and it is just the storage of plain text.
# Another type of data that one can store are numbers.

#When a number is being stored we do not need quotation marks.
#Quotation marks are used for words.
#Decimal numbers can also be used.

#A Boolean value can also be stored. This is a true or false value.
# There are many times where this will be useful.

#Strings, Numbers, and True or False Values are basic types of data.
