#Lesson 11 - Tuples
# A tuple is a type of data structure or a container where we can store different values.
# A tuple is like a list. It is a structure where we can store many pieces of information.
# There are key differences from lists however.
# Acommon example of a tuple are cordinates
# A tuple cannot be changed or modified

# A list can be modified or changed but a tuple cannot be changed it is immutable.


coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)]
coordinates[1] = 10
print(coordinates[1])
