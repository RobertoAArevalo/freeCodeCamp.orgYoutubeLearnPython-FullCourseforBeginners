# Lesson 28 - Modules and Pip

# Modules allow for files to be imported into other files.

#These 2 allow for this py file to access other py file and use functions from it.
    import useful_tools
    print(useful_tools.roll_dice(10))


#import docx

# This website has many useful python modules already created.
# There are built in modules into python that automatically gives people access to them
# And there are external modules that are stored in the folder that was used to download python
# Under External Libraries -> Python 3.8 -> lib-dynload.  There are many modules located here

#On the website, if I click on base64 it will tell me that the file is located at Source code: Lib/base64.py (external)
#On the website, binascii's location is not given because it is built into python.
# I may want to use a useful module someone else has created and it may not be inside of the lib folder already
# I can install those external 3rd party modules

# 1. Find a module https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html
# 2. Under here it gives instructions how to download the python doc module

# Pip is a program (preinstalled with python3) and it can be used to install python modules.
# Pip is also referred to as a package manager. Install, manage, update, and uninstall different python modules.

# Open Terminal
    # Terminal was not able to download pip although python 3.8 is already installed and currently running.
    # Terminal can also install Pip
